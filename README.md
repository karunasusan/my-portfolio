## üì¶ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you only need a web browser and a code editor.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/karunasusan/my-portfolio.git](https://github.com/karunasusan/my-portfolio.git)
    cd my-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install development dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` to manage Prettier for code formatting.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the project:**
    You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. For the best development experience, I recommend using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.

## üßπ Code Formatting

This repository uses **Prettier** to maintain consistent code formatting.

- **To check for formatting issues:**
  ```bash
  npm run format:check
  ```
- **To automatically format all files:**
  ```bash
  npm run format:write
  ```
  The `.prettierignore` file is set up to ignore minified files.

## üì§ Deployment

This static site is deployed and hosted with **Netlify**.

- The master branch is automatically built and deployed upon a push.
- The contact form is integrated with Netlify Forms.
- A custom `404.html` page is included.
