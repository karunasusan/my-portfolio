# Karuna Susan Benny - Frontend Developer Portfolio

🚧 **This portfolio is currently under heavy construction.** 🚧

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. I am rebuilding this project from the ground up to showcase my skills in modern web development, with a focus on clean code, responsive design, and a great user experience.

## About This Project

This project is a single-page portfolio designed to highlight my journey as a frontend developer. It will feature sections about me, my skills, the projects I've worked on, and how to get in touch.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **HTML5** - For semantic and accessible structure.
- **CSS3** - For modern styling, including Flexbox, Grid, and custom properties.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - For interactive elements and functionality.

## 🚀 Current Status

The project is in the initial development phase. The basic structure and styling are being set up.

## 🌟 Future Goals

- Implement a fully responsive, mobile-first design.
- Add a project section with cards linking to live demos and source code.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions for a better user experience.
- Optimize for performance and accessibility (a11y).

Feel free to check back soon to see the progress!
